# coinbase_checker
utility script to check and log coinbase balances

see `requirements.txt` for required libs.

you will need to set up an API key/secret. put these in `creds.py`. they just need read-balance privs.

to run, just run `account_checker.py`. it dumps out date/total-euro-value to a csv.
